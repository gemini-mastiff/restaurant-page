    <h2>The Home of Potato Goodness!</h2>
    <p>We're a simple family restaurant located in the siberian wilderness, far away from civilization. We dared to ask the question "Why isn't there any restaurants that serve exclusively potato-based products in the middle of nowhere?" and the rest is, as they say, history...</p>

    <p>We have been proudly serving the various animals that break into our kitchen for 87 years! We've had a few bear maulings in our time, but as our founder, Petyr Potato, said "You can't make a mash without crushing a few spuds!"</p>
